# ðŸš€ Frontend and Testing Guide

## Running the Front-End

The FastAPI application serves the web interface found in the `templates/` directory.
After installing the dependencies from `requirements.txt`, launch the server with:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Visit <http://localhost:8000> in your browser to access the frontend.
You can also start the entire stack using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Running Playwright Tests

End-to-end tests rely on Playwright. Install the browsers and run the tests with:

```bash
playwright install
pytest tests/e2e/
```

These tests open a headless browser and interact with the application.
